Description: This package lets you generate pseudo-random numbers using
    Pierre L'Ecuyer et al.'s MRG32K3a algorithm.
    The algorithm is coded in Fortran, for added performance.
    With this package you get independent streams for
    different random variables, as well as
    independent streams for the components of random vectors.
